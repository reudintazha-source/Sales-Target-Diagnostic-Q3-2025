The raw dataset and main working file used in this analysis are stored externally due to file size limitations.

## Data Limitation

The original Excel file used in this analysis is already finalized and exceeds GitHub’s file size limit.
To avoid reprocessing and to maintain data integrity, the raw dataset is not included in this repository.

This project focuses on analytical logic, KPI evaluation, and business insights derived from the data.

📌 Project Background
In this case study, I act as a Business Analyst supporting the Sales Manager in evaluating Q3 2025 sales targets, with a specific focus on September 2025.
The dataset used in this analysis is simulated (dummy) data and does not represent actual real-life figures.

The objective of this analysis is not only to assess whether targets are achieved, but also to: Identify potential under-target risks (targets set too low)

Evaluate whether KPIs and targets are aligned with:

-Area and depot activity potential

-Channel characteristics

-The role and responsibility of each Salesman Type

The analysis is conducted solely based on target data (Excel), using actual sales performance, applying internal logic and comparative analysis across targets.


1️⃣ Story 1 – Area & Depot Target Evaluation and Under-Target Risk
🎯 Business Question
Based on the data, what is the overall picture of sales targets across all Areas and Depots in Q3 2025, and does the combination of Target_UR and Target_CO indicate targets that may be too low or insufficiently challenging?

2️⃣Story 2 – Target Alignment with Salesman Type
🎯 Business Question
What targets are assigned to Salesmen, and do these targets reflect the characteristics of the channel (especially MT), or do they indicate targets that are potentially set too low?

3️⃣ Story 3 – KPI Evaluation by Salesman Type (KILLER PART)
🎯 Business Question
Based on the available data, what are the patterns of targets and activities for each Salesman_Type, and are there indications that KPIs for certain types are too low or insufficiently challenging?
